Backend Pipeline Notes - Syllabus Document Processing System

Infrastructure:
- Backend: Amazon AWS
- Database: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL
- Vector Database: Amazon OpenSearch Service
- Language: Python

Pipeline Components:

1. DOCUMENT UPLOAD FUNCTION
   - Accept syllabus documents in PDF or DOC/DOCX format
   - Accept user_id to track which user uploaded the document
   - Save uploaded files to Amazon S3 storage bucket
   - Store file metadata, storage link, and user_id in Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database
   - Return confirmation of successful upload

2. DOCUMENT PROCESSING FUNCTION
   - Monitor for new files in S3 bucket
   - Read PDF/DOC files and extract text content
   - Convert extracted content to structured JSON format
   - Store JSON files in database for further processing
   - Handle different document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX)

3. EMBEDDING GENERATION FUNCTION
   - Process JSON files to create text embeddings
   - Use AWS Bedrock embedding models (e.g., Amazon Titan)
   - Store embeddings in Amazon OpenSearch Service vector database
   - Associate embeddings with original document metadata
   - Handle chunking for large documents

4. QUERY AND RETRIEVAL FUNCTION
   - Accept user queries as input
   - Convert query to embedding using same model
   - Perform similarity search in Amazon OpenSearch Service vector database
   - Retrieve most relevant embeddings based on similarity scores
   - Return relevant document sections or full documents
   - Implement ranking and filtering options

Technical Considerations:
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use AWS Lambda or AWS App Runner for serverless processing
- Implement authentication and authorization using AWS IAM
- Consider document versioning and updates
- Optimize for performance with large document collections
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization
- Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
- Implement proper S3 bucket policies and security
